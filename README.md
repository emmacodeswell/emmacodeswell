## Hi there! ✨ Thanks for stopping by.

I'm Emma, a Front-End Web Developer based in Toronto, ON. 

When I'm not dreaming up new ideas to code, you'll find me deep-diving into a new skill (right now, it's creating SVGs!) or playing Dungeons & Dragons with friends. I am open to coffee chats, so feel free to reach out. ☕

I am currently looking for a remote front-end development position. 

My skills include:
- JavaScript, JSX, HTML5, and CSS3/SASS/SCSS
- React, Firebase, Git, and SQL
- Netlify, and Github pages
- Figma, Adobe Lightroom, and Clip Studio Paint
