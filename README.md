<h1 align="center">Hi there! I'm Emma. ðŸŒ»</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm an artist turned front-end web developer who can't seem to stop creating. âœ¨</h3>

When I'm not dreaming up new ideas to code, you'll find me deep-diving into a new skill (right now, it's creating SVGs!) or playing Dungeons & Dragons with friends. I am open to coffee chats, so feel free to reach out. â˜•

I am currently looking for a front-end development position. 

My skills include:
- JavaScript, JSX, HTML5, and CSS3/SASS/SCSS
- React, Firebase, Git, and SQL
- Netlify, and Github pages
- Figma, Adobe Lightroom, and Clip Studio Paint
